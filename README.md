The code browse the range and display for every numbers if they are prime number or not 

## [Day 4 - Remove items from a ArrayList](https://github.com/Gregoire-Dubois/100_days_Of_java/blob/main/ArrayList%20and%20ASCII)

In this code, I use again the code for first numbers. 
The goal of the code is to create a liste of first numbers and filtered it.
For filtered, I don't use foor loop and condition. 
I prefer use Stream.filter() and collect().

## [Day 6 - Formating message with MessageFormat()](https://github.com/Gregoire-Dubois/100_days_Of_java/blob/main/MessageFormat)

With this code I format text with class MessageFormat().

## [Day 7 - Display results with enumeration()](https://github.com/Gregoire-Dubois/100_days_Of_java/blob/main/Fibonacci%20%26%20enumeration())
This code generate 50 iterations in fibonacci sequence. 
The result is siplay with enumeration and collection class

## [Day 8 - Create Class](https://github.com/Gregoire-Dubois/100_days_Of_java/blob/main/Create%20Class)
