## [Day 44 - Join 2 tables in MySQL](https://github.com/Gregoire-Dubois/100_days_Of_java/blob/main/INNER%20JOIN%20MySql)

In this new exercise, the goal is to join 2 tables from the same database (MySql).

The first table is named "customers" and contains as fields:
- FirstName
- LastName
- Address
- City
- Phone

The second table is named "orders" and contains as fields:
- Customer ID
- OrderDate

## [Day 50 - Create ArrayList and filter data](https://github.com/Gregoire-Dubois/100_days_Of_java/blob/main/AddDataInArrayListAndFilterIt)
In this exercice, I create an ArrayList and insert Strings.
I Use Collection to manipulate data.

In my code, data is : "hello", "world", "how", "are", "you".
The result is [?, are, hello, how, world, you]

Words are filter by alphabetical order.

But "?" is first. Two notes for this point.
Result will be different if string begin with capital letter, and if caractere is not letter. 

Why ? Beacause the filter is make whit ASCII table. 
In table ASCII, caractere like "?" is before capital letter, and capital letter is befor lowercase letter.
